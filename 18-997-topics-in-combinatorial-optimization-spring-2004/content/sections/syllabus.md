Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

In this graduate-level course, we will be covering advanced topics in combinatorial optimization. We will start with non-bipartite matchings and cover many results extending the fundamental results of matchings, flows and matroids. The emphasis is on the derivation of purely combinatorial results, including min-max relations, and not so much on the corresponding algorithmic questions of how to find such objects (although we will be discussing a few algorithmic issues, such as minimizing submodular functions). The course will rely heavily on the recent 3-volume textbook by Lex Schrijver on Combinatorial Optimization. The intended audience consists of Ph.D. students interested in optimization, combinatorics, or combinatorial algorithms.

Prerequisites
-------------

Students taking this course should have had prior exposure to combinatorial optimization, for example, by taking 18.433 (Combinatorial Optimization ) or a similar course. This course assumes knowledge of bipartite matchings, spanning trees, and similar basic notions in combinatorial optimization.

Grading
-------

The grade assigned is based on students preparing scribe notes of the lectures and on class participation. The job of the scribe is to prepare a good set of lecture notes based on what was covered in lecture and additional readings.

Textbook
--------

Schrijver, Alexander. _Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency._ New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 2003. ISBN: 3540443894.

The textbook is the 3-volume book, but we will be covering only some of the 83 chapters. This is a marvelous book with lots of results, references and concise proofs. I will assume familiarity with many basic results in combinatorial optimization.

Topics
------

Here is a preliminary (and partial) list of topics to be discussed:

*   Ear decompositions
*   Nonbipartite matching
*   Gallai-Milgram and Bessy-Thomasse theorems on partitioning/covering graphs by directed paths/cycles
